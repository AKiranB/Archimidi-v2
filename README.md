# Archimidi-v2

The general concept behind Archimidi was to create a simple fullstack, MERN MIDI database website, where users can upload, favourite, download and preview midi files.

For some context, MIDI is defined as "a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors that connect a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers, and related audio devices for playing, editing, and recording music."

People can use MIDI clips to do fan covers of their favourite songs, swapping out instruments freely.

Archimidi is the final project for Ironhacks web development bootcamp. Originally created with fellow student Ismael Lo, I've now created a different branch to add
new features and styling.

To run this in your development environment:

Fork and Clone this repo, run npm install in both client and root folders.
Add environment variables to the .env file.
Start server and client --> runs on localhost:3000
