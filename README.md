# Archimidi-v2

Archimidi is my final project for Ironhacks web development bootcamp. Originally created with fellow student Ismael Lo, I've now created a different branch to add
new features and styling.

The general idea was to create a simple fullstack, MERN midi database website, where users can upload, like, download and preview midi files.

To run this in your development environment:

Fork and Clone this repo, run npm install in both client and root folders.
Add environment variables to the .env file.
Start server and client --> runs on localhost:3000
